# PYAD
PYAD (“pie-id” - Python YouTube Audio Downloader) is a command line executable written Python to search for YouTube videos and download them as mp3 audio. 

PYAD uses a few external libraries, namely youtube-search-python for sending HTTP GET requests to the YouTube API for video searching, and PyTube, for extracting the raw video/audio contents and downloading the best quality stream available. PYAD also uses Getch for exiting the program.
